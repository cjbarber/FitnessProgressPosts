### How To Write Awesome Progress Posts

The /r/Fitness Edition.

### Why Spend the Effort To Write Good Progress Posts?

There are two sides to this. Firstly, to the benefit of the community at /r/fitness, better progress posts provide more information for community members to learn from.

Secondly, a point that may be more persuasive to you, the reader, fitness progress posts with really exceptional formatting and content *get more upvotes*.

This means you'll get more comments, more feedback, more people telling you how awesome you look, whatever it is that you are after.

### But My Pictures Speak For Themselves
